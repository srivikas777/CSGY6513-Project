Augmentation library
====================

This library performs data augmentation between datasets from Auctus. You can use it to augment a dataset with a search result directly on your side without relying on the server. It is also used internally by Auctus to perform augmentations (the ``/augment`` endpoint downloads the dataset using this library, performs augmentation, then sends the result to you).

Installing datamart-augmentation
--------------------------------

You can get it directly from the Python Package Index using PIP::
