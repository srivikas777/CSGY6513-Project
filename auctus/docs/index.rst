Welcome to Auctus's documentation!
==================================

Auctus is a dataset search engine and data augmentation platform developed at New York University. It can be used to index the content of datasets from a variety of sources, that can later be queried to find data that can be joined or appended to a user's data.

The system can be found at this address: https://auctus.vida-nyu.org/

You can find the source code on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/ViDA-NYU/auctus/auctus
